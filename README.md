# Opencast (moodle-lifecyclestep_opencast)

[WIP] This is a step for [Life Cycle](https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_lifecycle), in which admins can decide for every course, whether the Opencast videos belonging to a Moodle course should be deleted in Opencast, and therefore also in Moodle, after a specific time set by the admin or not.

This plugin is originally written by Alexander Bias from [lern.link](https://lern.link/) on behalf of the [University of Ulm](https://www.uni-ulm.de/) in 2022 and now maintained by [Farbod Zamani](https://github.com/ferishili) from [elan e.V](https://elan-ev.de/).

## Requirements
- Opencast Server (Version 13 or later) and Moodle Server (Version 3.9 or later).

## Tested Versions
- Opencast Server 13.6
- Moodle 3.11 & Moodle 4.1

## Installation
